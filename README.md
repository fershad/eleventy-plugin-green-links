# eleventy-plugin-green-links

An Eleventy plugin which checks if links on a website are hosted on verified green hosting providers from [The Green Web Foundation's](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) Green Web dataset.

## What is a Green Web Host?

Verified green hosting providers are organisations that can demonstrate they are taking steps to avoid, reduce or offset the greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide their services. They provide evidence to The Green Web Foundation to show that they do this on a yearly basis, or better.

## Why does Green Web hosting matter?

Hosting & data center use accounts for [15% of a website's carbon emissions](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/).
